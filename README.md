`sobir` is an open-source R-library for separating illusions from
boundary lines.

A modified permutation test (based on [Phipson and
Smyth 2010](http://www.statsci.org/smyth/pubs/PermPValuesPreprint.pdf))
is applied to determine whether or not there is a statistically
significant constraint imposed on the maximum or minimum value of one
variable relative to another. In the instances where opposite boundaries
experience a constraint, this analysis is analagous to a correlation
test.

The value of this approach, however, is evident in the instances when
two variables aren’t correlated, but when the extremes of one are
constrained at one extreme of the other. This is best illustrated using
an example. A few examples are provided below.

The package has been made publically available, but is still under
ongoing development. Any feedback would be appreciated.

## Installation

`sobir` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (version
0.1.0). It’s **not** recommended that this version be used, however, as
there are some important improvements and bug fixes in version
0.1.1.9000, which can be installed using `devtools`.

``` r
library("devtools")
install_github("C4EcoSolutions/sobir")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(sobir)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Simulated data

#### Artificially constrained data

The data simulated below are simply two random normal variables with
mean = 0, standard deviation = 1 and n = 200.

An artificial boundary effect is imposed by removing all the points
beyond the line `y = 2x + 2`. This simulates a scenario in which the
maximum value of y is constrained when `x < 0`.

``` r
set.seed(1)
dat_sim = tibble(x = rnorm(200, mean = 0, sd = 1),
             y = rnorm(200, mean = 0, sd = 1)) %>%
  mutate(bound = 2*x+2,
         beyond_bound = ifelse(bound < y, TRUE, FALSE))

# Define the points that are within and beyond the artificial boundary line
dat_beyond = dplyr::filter(dat_sim, beyond_bound == TRUE)
dat_within = dplyr::filter(dat_sim, beyond_bound == FALSE)
```

The solid blue line is a simple linear regression line for the
constrained data, indicating a poor correlation between the variables,
as expected. The dashed grey line represents the artificial boundary
imposed on the random data; the points that where removed are
represented by the light grey open points.

We can define the area beyond the boundary as a no-data zone. Whether
the labelled top-left no-data zone reflects a significant constraint on
the maximum y values is to be
determined.

``` r
# Visualise the simulated data with the points beyond the boundary removed
dat_within %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2, intercept = 2, linetype = 2, col = "grey") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = dat_beyond, shape = 1, col = "lightgrey") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue", se = F) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -1.5, y = 1.5, label = "no-data\nzone") +
  lims(x = c(-3,3),
       y = c(-3,3)) +
  theme_bw() 
```

To see what the package is assessing in the analysis, the boundaries and
no-data zones can be extracted and visualised using the below functions.

``` r
# Extract boundary points (bpts object)
bpts_within = extract_bpts(dat_within$x, dat_within$y)

# Plot the boundaries
bpts_plot(bpts_within, xlab = "x", ylab = "y") 
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Extract%20and%20visualise%20artificial%20boundary%20points-1.png)<!-- -->

The analysis involves permuting the data `nsim` times to simulate a
random distribution of the sample space. This is the only variable that
needs to be explicitly defined. The greater `nsim`, the greater the
precision of the analysis but the longer the analysis will take. In this
instance, `nsim = 100`

The results can be visualised as histograms of the simulated no-data
zone distributions relative to the observed no-data zone areas.

``` r
# Run the permuation test
set.seed(1)
perm_within = perm_area(dat_within$x, dat_within$y, nsim = 100, boundary = "topl")

# Plot the results
perm_plot(perm_within, histogram = T)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Run%20the%20analysis%20on%20artificial%20data-1.png)<!-- -->

As expected, the only no-data zone that shows a significant constraint
is the top-left where the artificial constraint was imposed.

It is also possible to test all four no-data zones simultaneously by
defining `boundary = all`. This is not ordinarily recommended as it may
lead to “data dredging” or “p-hacking” (see
[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) for details).
Ideally, hypotheses should be generated a priori based on previous
studies or domain theory and tested accordingly. This is not unique to
this analysis approach, but is true for statistical inferences in
general.

``` r
# Run the permuation test
set.seed(1)
perm_within_all = perm_area(dat_within$x, dat_within$y, nsim = 100, boundary = "all")

# Plot the results
perm_plot(perm_within_all, histogram = T)
```

#### Random unconstrained data

For comparison, we can assess the significance of the same boundary on
the random data without the artifical constraint to test whether or not
the significan result is due to Type 1 error sensitivity.

``` r
# Run the permuation test
set.seed(1)
perm_random = perm_area(dat_sim$x, dat_sim$y, nsim = 100, boundary = "topl")

# Plot the results
perm_plot(perm_random, histogram = T)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Run%20the%20analysis%20on%20random%20data-1.png)<!-- -->

As expected, the no-data zone of the random data shows no significant
constraint on the top-left boundary.

### Empirical data

A similar analysis can be conducted on empirical data to test the
application of the `sobir` methods to relationships analysed and
discussed in peer-reviewed
literature.

#### Sankaran et al. 2005 Determinants of Woody Cover in African Savannas

The first dataset is sourced from a Nature article on the determinants
of woody cover in African
savannas.

``` r
dat_sankaran = read.csv(system.file("data", "WoodyAfrica.csv", package = "sobir"))
```

One of the key figures in the article shows the woody cover from sites
across the continent against the mean annual precipitation (MAP).

The data were analysed using a 99th quantile piece-wise linear
regression to identify the boundary line. The gradient of a subsequent
linear quantile regression for the data where MAP \< 650 mm was
established to be different than zero, according to the confidence
intervals around the gradient.

``` r
# Extract boundary points (bpts object)
bpts_sankaran = extract_bpts(dat_sankaran$MAP, dat_sankaran$Cover)

# Plot the boundaries
bpts_plot(bpts_sankaran, xlab = "MAP (mm)", ylab = "Woody Cover (%)") 
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Extract%20and%20visualise%20Sankaran%20boundary%20points-1.png)<!-- -->

The top-left boundary is hypothesised to be experiencing a significant
constraint, which reflects a constraint of the maximum woody cover at
low mean annual precipitation.

``` r
# Run the permuation test
set.seed(1)
perm_sankaran = perm_area(dat_sankaran$MAP, dat_sankaran$Cover, nsim = 100, boundary = "topl")

# Plot the results
perm_plot(perm_sankaran, histogram = T)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Run%20the%20Sankaran%20analysis-1.png)<!-- -->

The null hypothesis that the top-left boundary is random can be rejected
as the p-value is less than
0.05.

#### Mills et al. 2017 Effects of anabolic and catabolic nutrients on woody plant encroachment after long-term experimental fertilization in a South African savanna

The second empirical dataset is sourced from a PLoS ONE article on the
effects of different soil nutrients on woody plant encroachment after
long-term experimental
fertilization.

``` r
dat_mills = read.csv(system.file("data", "WoodyTowoomba.csv", package = "sobir"))
```

One of the key figures in the article shows the number of trees against
the ratio of soil Mn/Cu.

The data were statistically analysed by aggregating the tree abundance
into four bins (0-1, 2-4, 5-8, \>8) and running a Kruskal-Wallis rank
sum test on soil Mn/Cu across the bins. The soil Mn/Cu ratios were shown
to be significantly greater where tree abundance was greater (more
individual trees per plot).

``` r
dat_mills = dat_mills %>%
   mutate(MnCu = Mn/Cu)

# Extract boundary points (bpts object)
bpts_mills_mncu = extract_bpts(dat_mills$MnCu, dat_mills$TreeNum)

# Plot the boundaries
bpts_plot(bpts_mills_mncu, xlab = "Soil Mn/Cu", ylab = "Tree abundance") 
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Extract%20and%20visualise%20Mills%20boundary%20points-1.png)<!-- -->

In accordance with the Catabolic Theory, it was inferred that there were
boundary effects occuring at both the top-left and bottom-right
boundaries that represent a constraint on the maximum tree abundance at
lower Mn/Cu ratios and a constraint on the minimum tree abundance at
greater Mn/Cu ratios.

``` r
# Run the permuation tests
set.seed(1)
perm_mills_topl = perm_area(dat_mills$MnCu, dat_mills$TreeNum, nsim = 100, boundary = "topl")
perm_mills_botr = perm_area(dat_mills$MnCu, dat_mills$TreeNum, nsim = 100, boundary = "botr")

# Plot the results
perm_plot(perm_mills_topl, histogram = T)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Run%20the%20Mills%20analysis-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
perm_plot(perm_mills_botr, histogram = T)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C4EcoSolutions/sobir/master/vignettes/images/Run%20the%20Mills%20analysis-2.png)<!-- -->

The null hypotheses that the top-left and bottom-right boundaries are
random can both be rejected as the p-values are both less than 0.05.
